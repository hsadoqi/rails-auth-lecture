## Objectives

- Understand, theoretically, how authentication and authorization work
  - Understand the _difference_ between authentication and authorization and how they fit under the umbrella topic
    _auth_
- Discuss different encryption and hashing schemes, and `bcrypt` specifically
  - Do we want to ever store plaintext user passwords? (no)
- Augment a user model in rails using `bcrypt`, `password_digest`, and `has_secure_password`
- Build User sign up and sign in flows in Rails
- Review sessions and cookies, as well as implement sign up, log in, and log out

## Steps

### How does auth work in theory?

##### What is the difference between sign-in and sign up?

Sign-up happens once, and afterwards the information that is used to authenticate a user exists in the system for
sign-in.

Sign-up corresponds to _creating_ a new user. Sign-in is authenticating an already existing user with some identifying
piece of information.

##### What is authentication?

It boils down to a really interesting question: _Are you who you say you are?_ And we use the username/password as a
proxy for that. This is called [multi-factor authentication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-factor_authentication):
a method for confirming a user's identity via multiple pieces (factors) of identification, such as a username/password
that only the user has. Ideally, our users provide unique passwords for each site they sign up for and don't use
[common passwords](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/2016-most-common-passwords_us_587f9663e4b0c147f0bc299d), but
that's not always the case.

##### What is the difference between Authentication and Authorization?

Authorization happens after authentication. It's about scope, and specific information. _What is the user allowed to
see/interact with?_; what is the user **authorized** to see? Simply proving your identity does not mean you have
unlimited power or authority; providing my driver's license to the TSA may prove my identity but it doesn't mean I'm
**authorized** to fly the plane.

##### How do passwords work?

Do websites save our passwords? And if they do, how are they stored? Should a plaintext password ever be stored?

##### What is the difference between hashing and encrypting?

Encryption lets us turn some string of information into another, random-looking string. That's it - it just garbles the information. 'Good' encryption has two key properties.

1. No one can tell what was in the original message. (No one without the secret key, that is!)
2. No one can change the information in the encrypted message.

These are called security against _eavesdropping_ and _tampering_, respectively.

Hashing is a little different: the ultimate goal of one-way hashing is that it cannot be feasibly reversed. Like putting something through a meat grinder or a paper shredder, we cannot reverse the process. This means that no one, not even those doing the hashing, are able to reverse the process.
Hiding this information from ourselves is good. Having access to the actual passwords is a dangerous liability! If someone had access to our database, then they would have the passwords associated with lots of email addresses, which would mean they could steal a ton of people's identities. People are bad at using new passwords for each website, so your password database likely contains people's gmail passwords!
